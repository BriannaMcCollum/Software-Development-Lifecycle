My work from CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
It's important to remember that the functionality of a program is dependent on the needs of real people. A program shouldn't be viewed as an arbitrary checklist of things to get done, but rather pieces that fulfill people's needs. Talking directly to potential users is a good way to find what functionality a program needs. User Stories are built upon the experiences and needs of real potential customers, so they serve as the perfect basis to build a program around. A piece of program that serves a User Story has a good purpose.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I liked Agile a lot as I learned about it in this class, and I will be incorporating it into my programming in the future. I think the iterative approach is really good, as working on smaller pieces in succession over a giant chunk is a lot more manageable. The adaptability of Agile is also super nice. Oftentimes getting started can be the hardest part for me, as I want to have a big plan on how to tackle the program before I even start. I think Agile has made me more comfortable with uncertainty.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
This is quite a loaded question, as there are a lot of different factors to being a great software developer. I think being individually motivated is important, as being a successful autonomous programmer is vital to success. Agile, and no framework for that matter, will hold your hand the entire time and tell you exactly what to do. You don't need to be best friends with everyone on your team, but you need to be understanding and cooperative. Without solid teamwork, a team in any framework will fall apart.
